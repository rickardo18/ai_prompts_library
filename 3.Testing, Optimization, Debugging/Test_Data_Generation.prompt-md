I need to generate test data for the following database schema:
[Paste your schema here]

Please help me create a test data generation plan:
1. Suggest appropriate ranges or types of values for each field
2. Provide SQL or script to generate a diverse set of test data, including:
   - Normal cases
   - Edge cases
   - Invalid data to test error handling
3. Ensure referential integrity is maintained for related tables
4. Include any specific scenarios or data patterns crucial for thorough testing

The test data should be comprehensive enough to cover various testing scenarios while remaining manageable in size.
